## Code Validation


### HTML

### HTML Validation

For my HTML files, I have used [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

Due to the usage of Jinja syntax (e.g., `{% extends "base.html" %}` and `{{ form|crispy }}`) and authentication requirements, the following approach was used for validation:

1. Navigate to each individual page via the deployed Heroku app link.
2. Right-click the screen or use `CTRL+U` (`âŒ˜+U` on Mac) to "View page source."
3. Copy the complete HTML code and paste it into the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) option.
4. Fix any errors or warnings, revalidate, and record results.

All pages passed validation.

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.  The JS files in my project were not written by me but taken from Boutique Ado, Stripe and CountryField.

All files passed with no errors.  The Stripe one has an extra semi-colon and two undefined variables, but as it did not come from me I am leaving it alone.

All files passed with no errors.

## Bug Fixes
---

|Bug|Solution|Fixed?|
|-----|-----|-----|
| Images not rendering in products.html | Fix filepaths in fixtures.json and add media context processor to settings.py | Yes |
| Order confirmation emails not sending | Added missing line in webhook_handler.py for sending the email when order is made | Yes |
| 'Complete Order' button is not working | I had copy and pasted JavaScript from the Boutique Ado project, but I had used code from too far ahead, which was causing the issues. I used code from the appropriate stage and was able to fix it. | Yes |
| Add to basket function not working in wishlist | The line `redirect_url = request.POST.get('redirect_url')` in basket/views.py was causing the issue, as the button to 'add to basket' on the wishlist was not associated with an item_id in the same way that the 'add to basket' button is on the product detail page.  Added `<input type="hidden" name="redirect_url" value="{% url 'wishlist' %}">` to the button in wishlist.html | Yes |
| 401 errors for Stripe webhooks | Stopped using the Stripe CLI for testing as it was causing confusion by giving a different signing secret | Yes |
| Hamburger icon disappeared from navbar | Added navbar-light back in, as the hamburger icon visibility is dependent on it. | Yes |
| Sorting selector not displaying sorting choice correctly | Updated view and added a default sorting order of 'Name(A-Z)' | Yes |
