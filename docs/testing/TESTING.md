## Code Validation


### HTML Validation

For my HTML files, I have used [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

Due to the usage of Jinja syntax (e.g., `{% extends "base.html" %}` and `{{ form|crispy }}`) and authentication requirements, the following approach was used for validation:

1. Navigate to each individual page via the deployed Heroku app link.
2. Right-click the screen or use `CTRL+U` (`âŒ˜+U` on Mac) to "View page source."
3. Copy the complete HTML code and paste it into the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) option.
4. Fix any errors or warnings, revalidate, and record results.

All pages passed validation.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

All files passed with no errors.

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.  The JS files in my project were not written by me but taken from Boutique Ado, Stripe and CountryField.

All files passed with no errors.  The Stripe one has an extra semi-colon and two undefined variables, but as it did not come from me I am leaving it alone.

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

All files passed with no errors.

## Dev Tools/Real World Device Testing
---

Responsiveness testing was carried out using Google Dev Tools on the devices detailed within the below table. Responsiveness was evident on all features throughout all tested devices. 
  
<br>

### Dev Tools Device Testing - all features tested, issues noted below

| Device  | Feature    | Issue  | Fix  |
| ------- | ---------- | ------ |------|
| iPhone SE | Product Detail page | Page looked cramped | Changed to col-11 rather than col-12, added mx-auto |
| Nest Hub Max | All features | No issues | None needed |
| iPad Mini | All features | No issues | None needed |
| Asus Zenbook Fold | Scroll down | Can't see footer | This is a browser issue and not a responsivity issue |
   
<br>

### Real World Device Testing

| Device      | Feature    | Issue  | Fix  | 
| ------------| ---------- | ------ |------|
| Samsung S9 | All features | No issues | None needed |
| iPad Pro (2020) | All features |  No issues  | None needed |
| HP 15S laptop  | All features | No issues | None needed |
| iPad Pro 2021 |    All features      |    No issues    |  None needed |
| Google Pixel 6 | All features | No issues | None needed |
| Samsung S22 | All features | No issues | None needed |


### Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Chrome | Works as expected |
| Edge | Works as expected |
| Safari | Works as expected |
| Firefox | MailChimp box in footer looks cramped; arrows in quantity form that don't appear in other browswers |

## Lighthouse Audit

I tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool in Chrome Dev Tools on each page, in incognito mode.

I initially used the Lighthouse extension to test and was getting much better results for performance.  When I changed to the tool in dev tools, my pages scored much lower. I subsequently went back and tested every page with the dev tools method and these are the scores you see below.

Performance is much lower than I would like it to be, and I would fix this in future development.

I was more concerned that my accessibility scores would be adequate, which they appear to be.

## Stripe and Webhooks

### Stripe Payment Flow

| Test Step | Description | Expected Result | Status |
|-----------|------------|----------------|--------|
| **1. Load Checkout Page** | Navigate to the checkout page with a test product in the cart. | Page loads correctly with the expected order details. | Pass |
| **2. Initiate Payment** | Fill in delivery details and enter a valid test card (e.g., `4242 4242 4242 4242`) and use a valid CVC, expiration, and zip code. Click **Complete Order** button | Transaction is processed successfully, and the user is redirected to the confirmation page. | Pass |
| **3. Validate Webhook Trigger** | Check if the Stripe webhook is received and that there are green 200 messages on each (`payment-intent.created`, `charge.succeeded`, `payment_intent.succeeded`, `charge.updated`). | Webhook event is logged and processed correctly. | Pass |
| **4. Verify Order Database Entry** | Check if the order appears in the database. | Order data is correctly stored and matches the Stripe transaction ID. | Pass |
| **5. Test Payment Failure** | Use a failing test card (e.g., `4000 0000 0000 9995` for insufficient funds). | Payment is declined, and an error message appears. | Pass |
| **6. Check Email Notifications** | Confirm if an order confirmation email is sent to the customer. | Email is received with the correct order details. | Pass |
| **7. Test Authentication (3D Secure)** | Use a test card that **requires authentication** (`4000 0025 0000 3155`). | Stripe presents an authentication challenge (e.g., 3D Secure prompt). | Pass |
| **8. Confirm Authentication Success** | Approve the authentication challenge in Stripe's test modal. | Payment succeeds, user is redirected, and webhook fires. | Pass |
| **9. Test Authentication Failure** | Choose to fail the authentication challenge in Stripe's test modal. | Payment fails with an authentication error message. | Pass  |

## Bug Fixes
---

|Bug|Solution|Fixed?|
|-----|-----|-----|
| Images not rendering in products.html | Fix filepaths in fixtures.json and add media context processor to settings.py | Yes |
| Order confirmation emails not sending | Added missing line in webhook_handler.py for sending the email when order is made | Yes |
| 'Complete Order' button is not working | I had copy and pasted JavaScript from the Boutique Ado project, but I had used code from too far ahead, which was causing the issues. I used code from the appropriate stage and was able to fix it. | Yes |
| Add to basket function not working in wishlist | The line `redirect_url = request.POST.get('redirect_url')` in basket/views.py was causing the issue, as the button to 'add to basket' on the wishlist was not associated with an item_id in the same way that the 'add to basket' button is on the product detail page.  Added `<input type="hidden" name="redirect_url" value="{% url 'wishlist' %}">` to the button in wishlist.html | Yes |
| 401 errors for Stripe webhooks | Stopped using the Stripe CLI for testing as it was causing confusion by giving a different signing secret | Yes |
| Hamburger icon disappeared from navbar | Added navbar-light back in, as the hamburger icon visibility is dependent on it. | Yes |
| Sorting selector not displaying sorting choice correctly | Updated view and added a default sorting order of 'Name(A-Z)' | Yes |
